# Vagrant repository

This project aims to create a minimal vagrant repository to host private vagrant boxes.

## How to use

The project is build based on [Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/), so it shouldn't be hard to install.

You should set the `SYMFONY_ENV` environment variable to `prod`. Unless you want to do some development on this project, then `dev` will do a better job, because `app_dev.php` will be available.

Don't forget about `composer install`.

## Does it scale?

NO, scandir and generating everything at runtime isn't a good idea.

## Do you accept pull requests?

Yes, please create an issue first if you don't want to waste your time.

## How do I create a box?

The easiest way is to use an existing base box, ubuntu for example, modify it to your needs and run:

```
vagrant package --output VERSION.box
```
